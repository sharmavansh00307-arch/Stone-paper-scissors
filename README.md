The Stone Paper Scissors Game is a simple yet engaging web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the classic hand game “Rock Paper Scissors” where a player competes against the computer. The main objective of this project is to provide a fun way to understand the fundamentals of JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling, while also focusing on creating a visually appealing and responsive design.
